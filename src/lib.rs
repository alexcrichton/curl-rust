//! Rust bindings to the libcurl C library
//!
//! This crate contains bindings for an HTTP/HTTPS client which is powered by
//! [libcurl], the same library behind the `curl` command line tool. The API
//! currently closely matches that of libcurl itself, except that a Rustic layer
//! of safety is applied on top.
//!
//! [libcurl]: https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
//!
//! # The "Easy" API
//!
//! The easiest way to send a request is to use the `Easy` api which corresponds
//! to `CURL` in libcurl. This handle supports a wide variety of options and can
//! be used to make a single blocking request in a thread. Callbacks can be
//! specified to deal with data as it arrives and a handle can be reused to
//! cache connections and such.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::io::{stdout, Write};
//!
//! use curl::easy::Easy;
//!
//! // Write the contents of rust-lang.org to stdout
//! let mut easy = Easy::new();
//! easy.url("https://www.rust-lang.org/").unwrap();
//! easy.write_function(|data| {
//!     stdout().write_all(data).unwrap();
//!     Ok(data.len())
//! }).unwrap();
//! easy.perform().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # What about multiple concurrent HTTP requests?
//!
//! One option you have currently is to send multiple requests in multiple
//! threads, but otherwise libcurl has a "multi" interface for doing this
//! operation. Initial bindings of this interface can be found in the `multi`
//! module, but feedback is welcome!
//!
//! # Where does libcurl come from?
//!
//! This crate links to the `curl-sys` crate which is in turn responsible for
//! acquiring and linking to the libcurl library. Currently this crate will
//! build libcurl from source if one is not already detected on the system.
//!
//! There is a large number of releases for libcurl, all with different sets of
//! capabilities. Robust programs may wish to inspect `Version::get()` to test
//! what features are implemented in the linked build of libcurl at runtime.
//!
//! # Initialization
//!
//! The underlying libcurl library must be initialized before use and has
//! certain requirements on how this is done. Check the documentation for
//! [`init`] for more details.
