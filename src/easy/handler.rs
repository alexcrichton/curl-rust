/// Each easy handle can be thought of as a large builder before calling the
/// final `perform` function.
///
/// There are many many configuration options for each `Easy2` handle, and they
/// should all have their own documentation indicating what it affects and how
/// it interacts with other options. Some implementations of libcurl can use
/// this handle to interact with many different protocols, although by default
/// this crate only guarantees the HTTP/HTTPS protocols working.
///
/// Note that almost all methods on this structure which configure various
/// properties return a `Result`. This is largely used to detect whether the
/// underlying implementation of libcurl actually implements the option being
/// requested. If you're linked to a version of libcurl which doesn't support
/// the option, then an error will be returned. Some options also perform some
/// validation when they're set, and the error is returned through this vector.
///
/// Note that historically this library contained an `Easy` handle so this one's
/// called `Easy2`. The major difference between the `Easy` type is that an
/// `Easy2` structure uses a trait instead of closures for all of the callbacks
/// that curl can invoke. The `Easy` type is actually built on top of this
/// `Easy` type, and this `Easy2` type can be more flexible in some situations
/// due to the generic parameter.
///
/// There's not necessarily a right answer for which type is correct to use, but
/// as a general rule of thumb `Easy` is typically a reasonable choice for
/// synchronous I/O and `Easy2` is a good choice for asynchronous I/O.
